### Geometron rules:
 
- everyone participates
- consumption is participation
- always forgive, forgiveness above all else, humans have lost control of our lives/actions and we are all Evil and Good and it's time to move on
- always show compassion and empathy, try to help your fellow geometroners get through their day, feel good about themselves and their work
- when in doubt, don't argue, split--rather than seeking ONE right way to do a thing, if there is a choice between paths that both have supporters, split the project and do both paths. These paths might have the same participants or totally different ones.

### Phase 1 participants:

Target these people with posters, Facebook ads, 
random mathematicians
