# Geometron: Geometric Metalanguage

Geometron finally gets its own space on here, since it's clearly a separate project now from Action Geometry.  Many bifurcations need to happen now to make it clearer which project is which and what the applications are.  

Geometron is a language of glyphs, which describe geometric concepts which can be interpreted both by humans and machines.  It is intended to be universally applicable across all human cultures and languages and also across all physical machine architectures both present and future.  

The political and philosophical goal of Geometron is to eliminate layers in technology which are currently controlled by various priest classes, freeing technology and giving people more power over their machines.  

This is part of the larger system of knowledge I am building, which includes the Roctal system for physical data encoding, the Action Geometry system of physical constructions, Trash Magic philosophy and technology and art, and several other components.  So all the various commands in the instruction set that this language is built on as well as the more complex components which are built up recursively have octal addresses which can be expressed using Roctal.
