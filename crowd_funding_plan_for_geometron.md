## Crowd Funding Plan for Geometron


Self replicating meta-book.  You replicate it yourself.

lore tablets, shapes, videos, programs, text files, image files, html files, physical markings, roctal codes tablets.  All these are in a curriculum which self replicates the whole thing.  For different amounts of money you get different levels of help on customization, more hours, more tracks, and more help.  


##### core message:

Unlike numbers and specific languages, geometry appears to be innate in the human mind.  Geometron is a purely geometry-based way of communicating both between the human mind and machines and between human minds and each other. 

When we can't talk to machines, and machines can't understand us, all the power of our machines is handed over to the priest class who bridges this gap.  The only path to freedom is to remove all barriers between us and our machines.


##### Comparison to existing things:


 Unlike computer languages, geometron does not rely on characters, words or syntax based on an existing human language, although it can be used to graphically encode human languages with easy creation of custom fonts.  By using recursion to its fullest extent, Geometron enables creation not just of fonts for human languages but graphical language content such as schematic symbols, mathematical symbols, geographic directions and mapping data(GIS), various kinds of geometric art from different human cultures, and layout of metal layers for circuit fabrication.  Geometron information involves mapping to various spaces which can also be geometrically mapped, including especially the keyboard of a typical computer and a sequence of 8X8 grids which I use to create an address space for all the "words".   Words in Geometron all have a symbol glyph which describes that word to a human reader in graphical form(this glyph is also composed of glyphs, using recursion), an address in the aforementioned space, an "action", which can be a sequence of glyphs, an action carried out by a person or robot, or a sequence of commands in some computer language, and if it's being actively used, a key which corresponds to one of the usable keys on a keyboard that is part of the ASCII characters from "space" to "~", with "~" reserved for a special use.  
 
 compare to:
 
- logo(memorization and numbers)
- processing(memorization and numbers)
- java(memorization and numbers)
- scratch(useless)
- metafont(memorization and numbers)
- human language(pictographic and phonetic both)(does not interact well with machines and artifacts)
- "icons" used by web marketing people, graphic designers and their ilk(imprecise, owned by companies so not in Commons)
- art:painting, drawing, print making, sculpture(imprecise, not directly useful for machine fabrication now)
- 
 
 
#### features

all text files, custom shape tables, custom fonts, custom command symbol glyphs, language independent(human and computer)

### Hype concept

I base this on the woks of Galois in group theory but more importantly invoke the Romantic ideals represented by the *myth* of Galois in the collective imagination of todays thinkers.  This is an attempt to reboot the Enlightenment that privileges Geometry over other forms of math and philosophy.  Math and philosophy must be put on a more heroic and Romantic footing, and all based on geometry and art.  Lead with geometry, build art, then build philosophy from that and science on that and technology on that.  But it starts with the groups of Galois: groups built from a generator.    

 
Change description to "Geometry metalanguage" not "geometric", which can have other meanings. Or maybe "Geometry-based"

colors are not just colors, that stack is conceptually a layer or color or texture or material or floor for mapping buildings.  For directions in a multi-story building the operation 0320 might set the bottom floor, and 0321 might be to go to the first floor above bottom.  In materials handling, these might switch from HDPE of one color to another, or different layers in a microcircuit layout or switching from bike to walk in a park.

Geometron is simply the Language of freedom.  To write a book describing Geometron is to build a path to regaining control over our machines, wresting it loose from the technocrats.  

"code as literacy" is a vicious lie by evil people.  It is a path to total enslavement of all of humanity to a bureaucracy with absolute power and zero intelligence.  Taking a summer class in java will not give you power over your own car or phone.  On the contrary, we're building a society where the only people who make enough money to live in a city are those who help build the systems of enslavement.  And yet these people still have no real control over their own objects, often by laws written by still more mindless bureaucrat drones. Those who do not learn to "code" are relegated to an ever-larger underclass for whom the tech priests have no real use, and who are pushed around at random by those who control the new totalitarian society.  

The "tech" industry is a path to totalitarianism, nothing more and nothing less.  Only instead of a Mao or Stalin in charge(who will eventually die as humans do) we will have a vast collection of identical white men with beards furiously working to build the next illegal cab hailing program to "disrupt" an increasingly meaningless economy while everyone else is enslaved to this unthinking brute of a machine.  Already anyone who does not work on computers is being forced out of the cities by insane rents that can only be paid by the "tech" bandits with their equally insane incomes.   


This is an ART language.  It is connecting art and math to create a more universally understandable system for communication between people and machines.  All machines should be art.


## Applications:

 - education
 - mapping
 - custom marketing language
 - inventory description, tracking
 - scientific/engineering/math note taking
 - circuit board layout and direct CAM control, fully integrated CAD/CAM
 
### Why you should contribute:

 - Teach and learn introductory programming concepts to people with no math background and no english language background.  
 - Study and teach the "sacred" geometry of your faith(every religion has geometry in its symbology, this should apply to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Pagans at least, as these faiths all have rich geometric traditions). 
 - The bigger we all make this, the more we all benefit. The economics is the opposite of a pyramid scheme, it should be a net positive for all.  You can be part of creating a net-positive industrial system
 - Build your own brand/marketing language based on YOUR brand. 
 - Create custom fonts for languages with script other than English, especially languages where the direction is different--a font for a Semitic language that reads from right to left for instance is simply a change in one action command in the glyph, rather than an overall change in code as would be needed with most computer languages. 
 - Support my further research into this field, keep it all in the public domain. 
 - putting in money to a project helps create a feeling of commitment, hopefully increasing the chances that you are involved in further development. 
 - Find a new medium for your artistic expression
 - get a tool to use for free in your homeschool or private school curriculum
 - base a new mathematics textbook on it
 -

 - participation! This is yours.  Not mine.  You get your own piece of software, written by you and controlled by you which you can use for your stuff.  Or your friends stuff.  How much all this is worth is totally determined by *participation*.  There are no customers and I am not a supplier.  I'm a teacher and you and I are all participants.  If you also become a teacher this language can spread with exponential power.
 - when you put money in you are getting my time, and that is all, but that can be extremely powerful.  I'm going to be talking with others using these ideas and will be doing my best to connect people with other people in such a way as to maximize the value for all. I will not be your employee, contractor, project manager, investor, or partner.  I will simply be a person with ideas you can talk with to move your projects forward.  
 - you don't have to give *me* the money.  spend money directly in your organization to build this system out if you want to.  I don't care.  As long as you don't try to patent the core idea, go nuts with it, use it for your industry, your art, your beliefs, your culture.

### What I will do with the money

Live and work: teach, write, and build.  That's it.  I will not hire employees or contractors, buy inventory, buy new machines, or expensive parts or materials.  I will not ship anything to anyone.  My expenses are rent in an expensive city(DC), food, coffee, travel, and some miscellaneous consumables I use for my more physical projects such as duct tape.  My living expenses are between 2500 and 3000 per month, and right now I consult on low temperature quantum physics but my goal with this project is to be able to quit that and work full time to further this project.  If I had no other obligations I could tour to YOUR institution and spread this language for free so that it can be absorbed into many technological ecosystems.  The less I have to spend time consulting for military industrial complex projects, the faster this work can get done and the more wholly I can concentrate on it.  

I am writing a book.  It will exist in several spaces: tablets, html, manuscript glyphs, shapes, videos

### milestones prior to launch:

- standalone application that works(first version done now)
- ebook that teaches use of software by example with minimal English
- videos of use of software with voiceover explaining how it works, doing several typical things
- workflow must end with usable PDF document--this means I need a cleaner font, state stack, image stack and glyph editing with all four arrow keys


3 implementations: 

1. sticks and rope and chalk in the park
2. AG first construction shapes with pen on paper
3. processing implementation


Sections of book:

1. introduction, basis of concept, recursion, languages of languages, comparison to previous work. freedom manifesto statements, liberation from technocratic priesthood(video, printable pages, tablets, glyph manuscript, pdf, html)perhaps have a quick start guide here as one of the parallel tracks, html because that is minimum commitment, show a series of fast one-off examples, marking location on a dry erase board, in a park, on a screen, on paper, all very fast, all based on one of the simple lattices of 120 degrees, 60 degrees, or 90 degrees
2. tool intro construction: paper and tape, sticks and bolts and rope, processing language
3. roots of unity(video, printable pages, tablets, glyph manuscript with images, usable shapes and sticks, test program, standalone) also study angle halving, dividing by 3 and 60, discuss how it works with Earth, degrees vs radians vs complex numbers

5. motion on a lattice(video, test program, glyph manuscript, do it with sticks we already have)
6. layers, colors, materials, floors, concepts associated with 032x
7. dropping markers, going to markers, teleporting, geography, this is huge for park deployment, make practical directions with triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon
8. moving things around, moving images, using it to build stuff
9. image based font creation
9. recursion 1: shapes, shapes of shapes, fractals, scales etc
10. recursion 2: font creation, going between text and shape
11. Language structure, from physical layer through various functions and address spaces, ways spaces can be expanded, implemented, show the tablets, discuss paths for learning and teaching
12. specific treatment of physical layer with examples

- show how with something like "1agg~E~agg" can be used to make the "there exists" symbol very fast and easily, lead from there to a quick hebrew word and arabic word, making glyphs that move the other way (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Š-L-M)


### audio for video

- the purpose of science is to create links between the human mind and the physical world
- We already have infinite knowledge relative to human cognition.  Therefore the greatest frontier in science is the *organization* of knowledge
- GEEEEOOOOOMMMMMMEEEEETRRRRROOOONNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!
- We will smash the technocratic priesthood!!
- We will go back and reboot the math of the French Revolution.  Some bad ideology was frozen like a bug in amber, we need freedom metrology ANATOMICAL CUBITS! FATHOMS! flags and markers!
- what is the problem with our society? Above all it is the primacy of number over shape.  The supposed alternatives to capitalism. we need a language that expresses stories and shapes, not NUMBER vs. SHAP, beliefs 
- shape is built into mind, we all know fractions of the circle, roots of unity
- I have created a new language to be used to write languages, based on the ideas about shapes innate in the human mind, and designed to make it easier for humans to interact with machines and to communicate with each other about shapes, places and physical things
- This system has a physical layer, conceptual layers, addresses, and all of it is for non technical people, 
- NO ENGLISH! NO C! NO NUMBERS!  
- VIDEOS! HTML DOCS! TABLETS! PROCESSING CODE! TREASURE MAPS!


### Other videos:

Number worship and how to break out of it.  capitalism has failed as a means of production, it cannot be fixed without addressing fundamental mathematical philosophy.  This is a revolutionary activity which must attack the primacy of number by building language for technical work and value based on shape and story.  


### Why should you believe I can get this done?

- It's already working! 
- You can see from screenshots and videos that it already works and if you want to try it I have the download here with executables, instructions, and code as well as instructions to get the code working and lessons on how the whole thing works, as well as printable materials to keep track of the concepts, art, and to map keys on your keyboard.  All that is already done!  You can see that I can deliver on the first milestones.  
- Assurance that I can teach classes of diverse sets of people comes from the fact that I've done it before in many environments, from undergrad classes at Yale to rooms full of middles school kids, to an MMA gym and a hacker space.  Whether you're reachable physically or not, if you can get on an Internet or phone connection I can help you get started in this!  
- I'm not claiming I will write any new software--I'm not a programmer!  All I'm saying is that I will keep teaching and writing these ideas until someone writes and builds all the parts.  I'll write and create curricula and talk to people, and all you have to believe is that I can do that.  I like to tell people about ideas, and you can see my videos linked to here to get a feel for my style.

### Theory

0303,0304,0305,0306 are equivalent to selecting complex roots of unity, with 0334,0335 being multiplying or dividing by the next root of unity
0310,0311,0312,0313,0314,0315,0316 are all geometric sequences which get selected and which one moves between the elements of using 0336 and 0337. theta and theta_step represent a discrete vector space which 0330,0331,0332,0333 move around in by adding or subtracting one of the basis vectors.
The layers 032xx are simply a finite set with no operations, not a group or a ring or sequence. 
034x are actions of art and technology and not part of math per se
035x are 


### Note:

Great demo is Babylonian numbers from this reference: http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/ybc/analysis.html which describes calculating the square root of 2 in base 60 about 4000 years ago on a clay tablet.  There are photographic images which can be used to type in the Babylonian system using image grabbing. A whole system can be created and demonstrated and emailed to the creator of that work(the analysis not the dead Babylonians)
