## Crowd Funding Plan for Geometron


##### core message:

Unlike numbers and specific languages, geometry appears to be innate in the human mind.  Geometron is a purely geometric way of communicating both between the human mind and machines and with other human minds. 


##### Comparison to existing things:


 Unlike computer languages, geometron does not rely on characters, words or syntax based on an existing human language, although it can be used to encode human languages with easy creation of custom fonds.  By using recursion to its fullest extent, Geometron enables creation not just of fonts for human languages but graphical language content such as schematic symbols, mathematical symbols, various kinds of geometric art from different human cultures, and layout of metal layers for circuit fabrication.  Geometron information involves mapping to various spaces which can also be geometrically mapped, including especially the keyboard of a typical computer and a sequence of 8X8 grids which I use to create an address space for all the "words".   Words in Geometron all have a symbol glyph which describes that word to a human reader in graphical form(this glyph is also composed of glyphs, using recursion), an address in the aforementioned space, an "action", which can be a sequence of glyphs, an action carried out by a person or robot, or a sequence of commands in some computer language, and if it's being actively used, a key which corresponds to one of the usable keys on a keyboard that is part of the ASCII characters from "space" to "~", with "~" reserved for a special use.

### Demonstrations:

 
 
 
## Applications:

 - education
 - mapping
 - custom marketing language
 - inventory description, tracking
 - scientific/engineering/math note taking
 - circuit board layout and direct CAM control, fully integrated CAD/CAM
 
### Why you should contribute:

 - Teach and learn introductory programming concepts to people with no math background and no english language background.  
 - Study and teach the "sacred" geometry of your faith(every religion has geometry in its symbology, this should apply to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Pagans at least, as these faiths all have rich geometric traditions). 
 - The bigger we all make this, the more we all benefit. The economics is the opposite of a pyramid scheme, it should be a net positive for all.  You can be part of creating a net-positive industrial system
 - Build your own brand/marketing language based on YOUR brand. 
 - Create custom fonts for languages with script other than English, especially languages where the direction is different--a font for a Semitic language that reads from right to left for instance is simply a change in one action command in the glyph, rather than an overall change in code as would be needed with most computer languages. 
 - Support my further research into this field, keep it all in the public domain. 
 - putting in money to a project helps create a feeling of commitment, hopefully increasing the chances that you are involved in further development. 
 - Find a new medium for your artistic expression
 

### What you get when you contribute:


 - $0 Spread the word, watch my videos, read my papers, build things!  You don't need Federal Reserve debt currency to contribute, or to receive the benefits of my work or that of other contributors
 - $25 webinar access
 - $50 extra special webinar access
 - $100 Custom message/story told in series of image/memes
 - $1000 all day event to learn how to use it
 - $2000 all day event with custom stuff
 - $5000 weekend event
 - $10,000 3 months R&D
 - $50,000 1 year R&D
 - business in a box: I will help you build a custom mapping business with ads for *local* businesses, *for the kids!!* I don't want a share, or equity or licensing, it's all free, just please destroy the monopoly of Big Tech, destroy Google, destroy Facebook destroy yelp!!!! please!
 
### What I will do with the money

Live and work: teach, write, and build.  That's it.  I will not hire employees or contractors, buy inventory, buy new machines, or expensive parts or materials.  I will not ship anything to anyone.  My expenses are rent in an expensive city(DC), food, coffee, travel, and some miscellaneous consumables I use for my more physical projects such as duct tape.  My living expenses are between 2500 and 3000 per month, and right now I consult on low temperature quantum physics but my goal with this project is to be able to quit that and work full time to further this project.  If I had no other obligations I could tour to YOUR institution and spread this language for free so that it can be absorbed into many technological ecosystems.  The less I have to spend time consulting for military industrial complex projects, the faster this work can get done and the more wholly I can concentrate on it.  
 

### Future work

language for machine motion, robotics
3d for fabrication
trash printer
more support for more languages
better documentation


deploy to many platforms including:
- iOs, in iTunes store
- Android in google store
- microsoft phone as app
- python
- CNC/CAM
- 
### Visuals for video:

- my hand with sharpie, writing glyphs on a piece of wood
- my hand with pen writing glyphs on paper
- satellite photo with glyphs, map drawn one step at a time with cursor, then cut to me pacing out on an actual field.
- narration of using the system to draw things: square and triangle, zoom in of glyphs on screen
- pan across papers with printouts of the map of the addresses explain address concept
- zoom and pan slowly to show very simple movements, going between fingers on keys and cursor motions
- pan through processing code and explain how short and simple it is
- series of very short pans/zooms of things related: action geometry banner image, octahedra, images from instructables, wire coils, 
- slow pan down across printouts of documentation for metafont
- same for printouts of logo
- video of stuff happening in Scratch on screen"more useful than scratch, more versatile"
- show a quick sequence of amusing memes, talk about replacing commercial software(powerpoint)
- On mention of religious geometry, show quick sequence of images from all the major religions of their geometry: christian, jewish, muslim, hindu, buddhist, pagan at least
- begin with my face sitting on the floor
