## Crowd Funding Plan for Geometron


##### core message:

Unlike numbers and specific languages, geometry appears to be innate in the human mind.  Geometron is a purely geometric way of communicating both between the human mind and machines and with other human minds. 


##### Comparison to existing things:


 Unlike computer languages, geometron does not rely on characters, words or syntax based on an existing human language, although it can be used to encode human languages with easy creation of custom fonds.  By using recursion to its fullest extent, Geometron enables creation not just of fonts for human languages but graphical language content such as schematic symbols, mathematical symbols, various kinds of geometric art from different human cultures, and layout of metal layers for circuit fabrication.  Geometron information involves mapping to various spaces which can also be geometrically mapped, including especially the keyboard of a typical computer and a sequence of 8X8 grids which I use to create an address space for all the "words".   Words in Geometron all have a symbol glyph which describes that word to a human reader in graphical form(this glyph is also composed of glyphs, using recursion), an address in the aforementioned space, an "action", which can be a sequence of glyphs, an action carried out by a person or robot, or a sequence of commands in some computer language, and if it's being actively used, a key which corresponds to one of the usable keys on a keyboard that is part of the ASCII characters from "space" to "~", with "~" reserved for a special use.

### Why you should contribute:

 - Teach and learn introductory programming concepts to people with no math background and no english language background.  
 - Study and teach the "sacred" geometry of your faith(every religion has geometry in its symbology, this should apply to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Pagans at least, as these faiths all have rich geometric traditions). 
 - The bigger we all make this, the more we all benefit. The economics is the opposite of a pyramid scheme, it should be a net positive for all.  You can be part of creating a net-positive industrial system
 - Build your own brand/marketing language based on YOUR brand. 
 - Create custom fonts for languages with script other than English, especially languages where the direction is different--a font for a Semitic language that reads from right to left for instance is simply a change in one action command in the glyph, rather than an overall change in code as would be needed with most computer languages. 
 - Support my further research into this field, keep it all in the public domain. 
 - putting in money to a project helps create a feeling of commitment, hopefully increasing the chances that you are involved in further development. 
 - Find a new medium for your artistic expression
 - get a tool to use for free in your homeschool or private school curriculum
 - base a new mathematics textbook on it
 - 
 
 

### What you get when you contribute:


 - $0 Spread the word, watch my videos, read my papers, build things!  You don't need Federal Reserve debt currency to contribute, or to receive the benefits of my work or that of other contributors

 - $2000 all day event with custom stuff
 - $5000 weekend event
 - $10,000 3 months R&D
 - $50,000 1 year R&D
 - business in a box: I will help you build a custom mapping business with ads for *local* businesses, *for the kids!!* I don't want a share, or equity or licensing, it's all free, just please destroy the monopoly of Big Tech, destroy Google, destroy Facebook destroy yelp!!!! please!
 - participation! This is yours.  Not mine.  You get your own piece of software, written by you and controlled by you which you can use for your stuff.  Or your friends stuff.  How much all this is worth is totally determined by *participation*.  There are no customers and I am not a supplier.  I'm a teacher and you and I are all participants.  If you also become a teacher this language can spread with exponential power.
 - when you put money in you are getting my time, and that is all, but that can be extremely powerful.  I'm going to be talking with others using these ideas and will be doing my best to connect people with other people in such a way as to maximize the value for all. I will not be your employee, contractor, project manager, investor, or partner.  I will simply be a person with ideas you can talk with to move your projects forward.  
 - you don't have to give *me* the money.  spend money directly in your organization to build this system out if you want to.  I don't care.  As long as you don't try to patent the core idea, go nuts with it, use it for your industry, your art, your beliefs, your culture.
### What I will do with the money

Live and work: teach, write, and build.  That's it.  I will not hire employees or contractors, buy inventory, buy new machines, or expensive parts or materials.  I will not ship anything to anyone.  My expenses are rent in an expensive city(DC), food, coffee, travel, and some miscellaneous consumables I use for my more physical projects such as duct tape.  My living expenses are between 2500 and 3000 per month, and right now I consult on low temperature quantum physics but my goal with this project is to be able to quit that and work full time to further this project.  If I had no other obligations I could tour to YOUR institution and spread this language for free so that it can be absorbed into many technological ecosystems.  The less I have to spend time consulting for military industrial complex projects, the faster this work can get done and the more wholly I can concentrate on it.  

### milestones prior to launch:

- standalone application that works(first version done now)
- ebook that teaches use of software by example without language
- videos of use of software with voiceover explaining how it works, doing several typical things
- workflow must end with usable PDF document--this means I need a cleaner font, state stack, image stack and glyph editing with all four arrow keys
 
 
### Milestones for *future* work:

 - web app that runs in browser
 - Full self contained package for download: .txt files, full ebook in pdf form, links to videos, executables for mac and pc, and processing files

### Other videos:

Number worship and how to break out of it.  capitalism has failed as a means of production, it cannot be fixed without addressing fundamental mathematical philosophy.  This is a revolutionary activity which must attack the primacy of number by building language for technical work and value based on shape and story.  


### Why should you believe I can get this done?

- It's already working! 
- You can see from screenshots and videos that it already works and if you want to try it I have the download here with executables, instructions, and code as well as instructions to get the code working and lessons on how the whole thing works, as well as printable materials to keep track of the concepts, art, and to map keys on your keyboard.  All that is already done!  You can see that I can deliver on the first milestones.  
- Assurance that I can teach classes of diverse sets of people comes from the fact that I've done it before in many environments, from undergrad classes at Yale to rooms full of middles school kids, to an MMA gym and a hacker space.  Whether you're reachable physically or not, if you can get on an Internet or phone connection I can help you get started in this!  
- I'm not claiming I will write any new software--I'm not a programmer!  All I'm saying is that I will keep teaching and writing these ideas until someone writes and builds all the parts.  I'll write and create curricula and talk to people, and all you have to believe is that I can do that.  I like to tell people about ideas, and you can see my videos linked to here to get a feel for my style.
