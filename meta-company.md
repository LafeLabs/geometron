### Lafelabs.org: a meta-company

I am a one person Virginia LLC.  It is my goal to only teach and discuss and write.  I will help spread ideas only, and if those ides work, the fraction of the value of those ideas that I will take from the value stream will approach zero as the project grows.

things I will not do:

- hire anyone but myself
- sell equity
- sell debt
- buy inventory
- ship inventory
- deliver a product of any kind
- create or claim any intellectual property of any kind
- take equity or debt in another company as payment

Things I will do:

 - help create working groups to build things 
 - teach how to use geometron
 - create manuscripts and promote them
 - help create brand languages for corporations to communicate more easily both within the company and with customers, investors and partners.
 - work with people in various locations to build maps and map creation systems local and fractal to their location
 - direct spreading of Geometron in physical space: by museums, libraries, university campuses, monuments, parks, conferences,

 List of offshoot working groups and companies
 
 After this is a applications section, with:

Military 
Intelligence
quantum computing
mapping
religion
art
memes

After this is my deployment plan for geometron specifically.  This is essentially a series of funding proposals as well as a business plan for me as an individual to simply travel and teach until the thing is seeded in all these fields.  Customer list here:

 - IARPA
 - IBM
 - Chad
 - Google quantum
 - NIST
 - DARPA
 - Army, navy, air force, marines, various special forces
 - CIA
 - NSA
 
 

After this is my plan for moving from Geometron into the consequences for a Free World: Trash Magic, working with veterans and refugees, the meta-company, my business plan, my religion etc.  

Documents I plan to create:

- Geometron Presents Geometron, a tutorial, definition and instance for the Geometron language
- Action Geometry
- Applied Modern Alchemy, or Trash Magic Volume II
- Pentagons for Pentagonians: a whimsical introduction to geometric metalanguage for members of the military industrial complex 
- Geometry for the Children of Euclid
- Quantum Noise and Amplification
- Vibratron Meta-motor full documentation
- Geometron VR hyperspace
- my memoir 
- Electromagnetism textbook based on coils of wire and useful objects, all based on trash or is this part of the trash magic core?  Perhaps I should have a separate book outside the trash magic core designed for actual classroom use inside the System.  
- Applied Roctal Archiving. While Roctal is *defined* in GPG referenced above, this is an actual instance of it, including the full hardware that connects the camera and screen with the machine to write data
 


Geometron Hypercube Instances:

 -  crystal city map
 - DC mall map
 - organic chemistry(2d)
 - organic chemistry(3d)
 - All of the world's major religions
 - general circuits
 - trash magic
 - quantum computing theory
 - quantum computing UX
 - SQUID design/fabrication
