### Lafelabs.org: a meta-company

I am a one person Virginia LLC.  It is my goal to only teach and discuss and write.  I will help spread ideas only, and if those ides work, the fraction of the value of those ideas that I will take from the value stream will approach zero as the project grows.

things I will not do:

- hire anyone but myself
- sell equity
- sell debt
- buy inventory
- ship inventory
- deliver a product of any kind
- create or claim any intellectual property of any kind
- take equity or debt in another company as payment
- direct passive interviews with journalists, bloggers or other members of the Media

Things I will do:

 - help create working groups, known as "parties", "tribes", "units", "working groups", "cohorts" etc. to build things as groups 
 - teach how to use geometron by direct contact with people
 - teach by one on one video conferencing
 - create youtube content explaining the whole thing
 - create manuscripts and promote them
 - help create brand languages for corporations to communicate more easily both within the company and with customers, investors and partners.
 - work with people in various locations to build maps and map creation systems local and fractal to their location
 - direct spreading of Geometron in physical space: by museums, libraries, university campuses, monuments, parks, conferences, 
 - work with media people who are willing to actively engage in building their own geometric languages
 
 
 
 Acceptable business expenses:
 
  - minor consumables like tape, solder, clothesline
  - art supplies
  - travel
  - advertising/media outreach
 
 
 
 List of applications:
 
 List of customers:
 
 List of offshoot working groups and companies
 
 After this is a applications section, with:

Military 
Intelligence
quantum computing
mapping
religion
art
memes

After this is my deployment plan for geometron specifically.  This is essentially a series of funding proposals as well as a business plan for me as an individual to simply travel and teach until the thing is seeded in all these fields.  Customer list here:

 - IARPA
 - IBM
 - Chad
 - Google quantum
 - NIST
 - DARPA
 - Army, navy, air force, marines, various special forces
 - CIA
 - NSA
 
 

After this is my plan for moving from Geometron into the consequences for a Free World: Trash Magic, working with veterans and refugees, the meta-company, my business plan, my religion etc.  

Documents I plan to create:

- Geometron Presents Geometron, a tutorial, definition and instance for the Geometron language
- Action Geometry
- Applied Modern Alchemy, or Trash Magic Volume II
- Pentagons for Pentagonians: a whimsical introduction to geometric metalanguage for members of the military industrial complex 
- Geometry for the Children of Euclid
- Quantum Noise and Amplification(get co-authors on this)
- Vibratron Meta-motor full documentation
- Geometron VR hyperspace
- my memoir 
- Electromagnetism textbook based on coils of wire and useful objects, all based on trash or is this part of the trash magic core?  Perhaps I should have a separate book outside the trash magic core designed for actual classroom use inside the System.  
- Applied Roctal Archiving. While Roctal is *defined* in GPG referenced above, this is an actual instance of it, including the full hardware that connects the camera and screen with the machine to write data
 


Geometron Hypercube Instances:

 -  crystal city map
 - DC mall map
 - organic chemistry(2d)
 - organic chemistry(3d)
 - All of the world's major religions
 - general circuits
 - trash magic
 - quantum computing theory
 - quantum computing UX
 - SQUID design/fabrication
 

### Business Plan

phase 0 : current phase, which is preparation, media creation, outreach

phase 0.5: build campaign and get people on board before launch

phase 1:

The first stage is to do a crowd *source* campaign which uses multiple media platforms to create multiple swarms of creators/users who will build multiple self-documenting and self-replicating geometron hypercube instances, with built in tales and lore.  I will make media content, respond to messages, travel, meet with people, spread the word in physical space, put up fliers, email people, and code as needed to build out all these instances.  Some people will put money in, and that will get me through the initial launch over the summer. Launch should be as soon as possible, I need a pre-launch checklist.  The goals of phase 1 are to get some  kind of minimal income to cover personal expenses, 3k/month would be more than sufficient, and to get the instances to be presentable to Respectable donors

phase 1 goal is to raise enough money to get out of credit card debt and survive until the first real DoD grant, which is the goal.  If I can raise a total of 20k between multiple campaigns over a few months this should work, especially if I can get some other sales and labor added in.  Not much money but enough to survive til next fiscal year grants


Phase 2:

Formally apply for money and launch the quantum information geometron hypercube instance, using existing quantum work and connections to get top QC people on board.  Get sponsorship from an intelligence agency such as IARPA, NSA or DARPA.  Work with top QC players to build self-sustaining and self-replicating system.

Here I want to get solid grant income for at least a couple years out.

Phase 3: 

Leverage pure quantum IC funding into grant proposals for field agents in the IC for mapping and codes, then leverage that into grants for DoD war fighters also for intelligence communications in the form of mapping and codes, add brand information for boosting morale such as unit history and culture for groups of war fighters.  Build a self-sustaining information ecosystem that can propagate throughout the DoD ecosystem on its own.  

immediately after phase 2 grants start pushing for phase 3

Phase 4: 

Leverage success in phase 3 into funding for Trash Magic inside DoD for use by troops in the field for addressing supply chain issues.  The goal is to eliminate the whole supply chain from the troops in the field, removing that as a vulnerability.  you can't attack a supply chain that doesn't exist, and it also puts the Army to their goal of net zero waste.  

Phase 5:

Branch out active duty DoD personnel to veterans and refugees, get funding and allies in the aid industrial complex and non profit industrial complex to deploy Trash Magic based on Geometron into the homeless vet population and the refugee population overseas.  From here, build a new religious system which spreads naturally around the world, eliminating global poverty.  Here the focus is on large scale automation, food production, medicine, and the rest of the complete set, as well as moving humanity into the oceans.


#### Crowd fund Checklist:


before launch:

 - main video
 - series of videos describing geometron
 - put the story up on indiegogo(obviously)
 - contact indiegoqgo support about the campaign
 - use Facebook to mass-friend everyone i've ever known and spam them about the campaign
 - rework lafelabs.org web page so it can be the main reference point on Geometron
 - reasonable awards and goals list
 - fill out all the profile stuff on indiegoqgo
 - build a Facebook following of a couple hundred at least
 - build a geometron mailing list
 
 At launch:

 - email everyone i know in physics about the quantum geometron 
 - email random people in linguistics, math and computer science, email all computer science people i know 
 - spam linked in network
 - spam face book network 
 - buy Facebook ads
 - put up fliers in math, cs, physics, art and linguistics buildings at UMD, GW, Howard, Georgetown, and around NSA, CIA, pentagon, DARPA
 - set up a street act with the thing to show people on the Mall
 - keep the mailing list looped in
 - post updates on progress on construction of the Geometron Hypercubes regularly and spread that thru social media

 
 awards: unrelated to money
 
 money: 

- $5  if 500 people do this it's useful.  It shows your support, but if you only have 5 bucks maybe just get yourself a snack instead.
 - $10  a few hundred of these are required to really help.  It's nice, though, thanks!
 - $50 this is great!  this support is very useful, only do this if you have some cash to burn though 
 - $100  this is starting to really add up, making the smaller donations less needed, thanks!
 - $200  Only a few of these are needed to pay my rent, at this level we can have a manageable community and i can do this full time
 - $500  1/3 of rent.  A few of these and my life sucks a LOT less
 - $1,000  getting to rent-levels.  A few of these and I'm really living ok, as long as they keep coming in...
 - $1,500 rent!  I'll go into my math/cs space a million hours a day here
 - $2,000  almost living expenses. but not quite
 - $3,000  a month of living expenses!
 - $6,000   two months is enough time to really get lost in a project, make huge strides, ignore all distractions
 - $10,000  This can be a 2-3 month period with a bunch of travel, paying for nice Amtrak tickets to get around and stay in hotels part of the time
 - $30,000  This is over half a year with significant travel expenses, and maybe actually getting health insurance
 - $50,000  a year's funding, with some travel
 - $100,000 A year's expenses with extensive travel, including overseas , and money saved to do totally pure zero strings attached research for a while after the year is up with no contact with the World at all.  If I find a couple sources for these grants every couple years, all things on here can be free for everyone for all eternity(they will be anyway but I might have to find other work to get money).  This is your chance to create a whole new field for not much money if you're a funder.

If you want to do that and not pay me, I'm ok with that. Paying me is always voluntary.  


This project is:

 - an artistic movement
 - a programming educational tool
 - an art education tool
 - a tool for building and using brand languages online to save time in online marketing
 - a tool for rapid communication in all sciences and technical disciplines
 - specifically a tool for the quantum information community to share circuit diagrams, slides, conceptual diagrams,
 - meme generator
 - custom language builder for use with things like cuneiform
 - machine control for raw simple hardware
  
  
  Also, instead of tale and lore, perhaps tale and propagator, where propagator is the information that make more instances.  tale is where the thing came from and propagator is where it is going.  This is not action/symbol, it's TIME. 

Names of a group:

- group
- lab
- cohort
- coven
