## The Pitch

The Geometron Art Engine is an alternative way to use machines to process art.  Rather than leading with numbers and using them to build art(the only thing "computers are really good for in most cases") we lead with art and use that to build up the whole system.  This virtual machine exists in your mind, your body, your computer, your browser, the tools you use to build your art, and the industrial machines of the future that I hope will replace the numbers based machines of today.  

What is an art engine?  [use visual aid of a page from a free newspaper with a picture, draw a mustache on it, write a funny word balloon]  This is an art engine, it's a picture with some words and graphics on it.  It's the main type of machine that drives the "information economy".  This is NOT powerful because it's a computer.  We're using computers to build our art engines, but we can also use an art engine to do math: [do long multiplication on paper].  It's slow and painful, but still very powerful compared to doing math in our heads.  The computer industry has tricked us into believing that adding up of numbers is the basis of their power, but this contradicts what we see around us: the world-changing power of technology is in how we all share images, words, and simple graphics like arrows, icons, emoticons, etc.  This is true at every level: most of the highest level decisions about allocating funds which drive this whole economy are made based on simple graphics and a few words on powerpoint slides.  The addictive nature of things like Facebook that keep the whole machine running is largely memes, again images with a little text and simple cartoons.  

I claim that in all computer systems there is something called an "art stack" which needs to be added in order to understand *any* computer.  Consider any computer form Turing's Bombe to the iPhone or Arduino.  What was the first thing that happened before the first experimental prototype got built?  Someone made a pitch to someone else, communicating the idea that this computer should be built.  That pitch was probably at its core a very simple set of a few words and graphics.  And in todays world that is always made on yet another computer.  This is how a computer self replicates: it has software that lets humans communicate the idea of how to build another computer.  

I'm anti-computer.  I think they have overwhelmingly harmed us as people, and I hate the world they have built.  I believe that if we want to hack the underlying system of what makes computers awful we have to address their core reproductive function, which is the art stack.

## Video Script

The computer is the most powerful machine in our society today, but why?  It's not the math it does, it's the art: we mostly use computers to communicate, with a few words and a lot of graphics.  Most models of how computers work ignores the fundamental nature of this "art stack": that without a powerpoint slide with some cartoons and a couple words, no modern computer would ever get built.  The use of graphical communication is fundamental to the very existence of not only the modern computer but all things built in our society.  Building a more free and universal language for that task can help a lot of people!

I have built a universal language to control machines and describe physical things based on geometry.  Geometron, or the Art Engine, is based on symbols[show symbols here] which describe actions[show actions here].  I have been implementing it in computer code to run inside any web browser[show it in web browser, then show graphic of javascript, html and css], as well as physically to be expressed with pen and paper[show an action and symbol on paper] and in simple robotic machines[show pen action in robot].

With your help, I will compile my large quantity of art, writing, and code into a single published book which documents this language.  At its core, this is a tool to build tools.  If it's going to work, it needs *you* to start using it to build *your* tools to make *your* art.  

I've done this before: I've written books, and had them published through the LuLu press print on demand service, so I know I can do it and that everything will actually work[show existing books].  And I've already written the software that should be able to launch a user base for Geometron and written a bunch of the documentation.  I need your help getting the time to focus 100% on finishing this book, editing it, and getting it out in a form that all can use. The ebook will be free for all the world, as will the language.  

I'm not going to build the real software.  You all are, and people inside existing organizations.  The government will build things for themselves, Facebook, microsoft, etc.  I'm just a person who has ideas and writes about them.  

Let's build this language and make some new art!
